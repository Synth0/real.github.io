## about
seraph attempts to be a clean and easy-to-use solution for playing various online games without any unnecessary elements to it, such as advertisments or a confusing to use user interface. 

unlike most other game hosting websites, seraph supports and encourages hosting, meaning that you can host the entire website's code for yourself to run and play for yourslef without a fear of having to find a new website in the event that seraph gets blocked.

seraph was made as a fun side project in order to alleviate everything i've felt was always annoying to use about online game websites. i hope you find your use of this project as i certainly am :)
